1. Stop map.locate() from updating view when user is zooming and using the map. Otherwise the map resets every 5 seconds or so and the user cannot take a broader view of the map.
2. Handle position errors.
3. Keep text on display in the surroundings of the location once opened, and keep all opened texts in a folder that the user can open whenever they like.
