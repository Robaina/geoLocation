1. Convert exit screen into a dialog window
2. Make disclaimer screen on first visit
3. Show pop up when new location visited alongside vibration, the pop up contains the title of the place, some text and a button "mostrar mas..." to go to the complete location text.
4. webstorage not always works in incognito mode, tell user
5. Firefox requests permission for vibration api
6. Would be nice to add settings sections with things like remove/enable audio, dark/light mode...
7. Add audio effects, e.g., typing audio and some music
8. Enable changing location texts from the displayed text, ideally swiping, but prob not possible on web. I could add arrow buttons on the sides.
